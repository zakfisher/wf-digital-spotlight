                    <p>CK: My most important tip is to set your learning objectives up front and select an email topic that warrants the use of video. Don’t use video just because of the cool technology, because you may not notice an increase in engagement. Use video if you believe it will help improve the overall user experience, engagement and conversion.</p>

                    <p>CK: Throughout the holiday season, visitors will be surprised by local Merry Makers who will provide random acts of kindness and customer service at the Centers. A short video of the Westfield Merry Makers in action will capture this very experiential moment which will be shared via YouTube, Westfield.com, Facebook, Twitter, and also embedded in an email. With the technology provided by Liveclicker, users of specific email clients such as Outlook (web based), Gmail and Yahoo are now able to view actual video within their email. Depending on the email client, some may receive video and audio, others will receive animated gifs or a static image. Liveclicker’s Smart Video Versioning technology identifies the email client when the email is opened and serves up the most compatible video within the email.</p>

                    <p>CK: There were very few obstacles to execute the embedded video in email (EVE) campaign. The greatest obstacles weren’t anything that I would consider a major challenge. They were as basic as creating the video and developing creative that would work within our current email template. The actual technology is very user friendly and the pricing structure makes it very easy to test as we are simply charged by the number of impressions (or video views).</p>

                    <p>CK: The technology is probably quite advanced, but from a user’s standpoint, it’s quite simple. Simply upload your selected video via a typical file upload process or provide a URL link (including YouTube). You can configure the video by selecting a static image for email clients that don’t support the technology, setting the length of the video, selecting the width and height, choose to have the video auto start, or even loop. Once configured, you can test the video with the provided email embed code and place it into your email. If approved, you simply deploy the email as you normally do then track the impressions and views through Liveclicker’s reporting and analytics.</p>
